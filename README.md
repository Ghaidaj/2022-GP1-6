# Help App
# intoduction
Help app provide a solution that assists the user in his emergencies as quickly as possible and with minimal effort. Our application will help those who are in a state of panic, or who are present in an accident and wish to request or provide assistance. When the user presses the “Help Me” button a message will be sent to his preselected contacts with his current location and condition to inform them that he is in danger so they can rush to help him. On the other hand, when the user is present in an accident and wishes to assist but forgets what he should do.  He just needs to press the “help them” button and the application will show a map that leads him to the nearest hospital or fire station (using Google Place API). Also, the application will give him a list of emergency centers numbers so he can request any of them. All these steps that may need multiple applications will be in one application.
